Oh man, just leaped outta Control Freak and... what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Still shaking popcorn outta my shirt, and my back's protesting from those old theater seats. Buzzing with all these twisted images. You know that feeling when your pipes finally unclog, that rush of everything suddenly making sense, but like, on an emotional rollercoaster?

Can’t even piece it together right now... it’s like, one moment, I was there, in the middle of that chaotic chase somewhere in the future and the next, I think my phone vibrated but it was just the surround sound rattling the whole place. The dude with all those knobs, totally like a conductor for a symphony of chaos, you know? The entire crowd just gasped when he did his mind-bendy thing, but you could hear a pin drop, just crunching under my shoes' popcorn.

And somewhere amidst it all, I could swear the protagonist had this moment, standing atop a skyscraper, looking as overwhelmed as a plumber facing a septic explosion. Clarity amidst mayhem. I was also supposed to remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, Susie asked if it's worth it but my head's still spinning too much to say.

> Oh, and there was that bit with the car, turning into what, some kind of mechanical octopus? God, what even — something only a lunatic or a genius would conjure, like me trying to fit a faucet where there ain't no pipe! Now, can’t unsee it, gonna haunt me forever.

Randomly thought of Fred from the hardware store — he’d probably enjoy it, loves those indie flicks that twist your brain like that pipe that never fits no matter how you turn it. Should text him to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but the signal’s rubbish in here, keeps dropping like my energy half through a shift.

Theater's emptying out now, still echoing with snippets of disbelief and awe. My mind's kinda mushy, like hair caught in a drain. Jumbled thoughts in my head like fitting a square into a round peg. Gotta get home before these feelings rinse away down the mental plughole.
